- [x] Comprehensive testing (19 tests: 8 integration + 3 performance + 8 unit)
- [x] Documentation (TESTING.md, COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md, REALISTIC_NEXT_STEPS.md)
- [x] Model validation (Qwen 2.5: 0.5B, 1.5B, 7B; Mistral 7B v0.3)
- [x] docs/MODELS.md with compatibility matrix
- [x] README updated with model references
- [x] Modern CLI UX (clean symbols, progress indicators, no emojis)

**Current version:** 0.0.5

## ✅ 0.0.4 - Model Validation (Complete!)

**Goal:** Verify vllama works with popular models ✅

### Tested Models ✅
- [x] **Qwen 2.5 0.5B** - Works! (50% GPU, 0.9 GiB, 819K cache)
- [x] **Qwen 2.5 1.5B** - Works! (50% GPU, 2.9 GiB, 277K cache)
- [x] **Qwen 2.5 7B** - Works! (90% GPU, 14.2 GiB, 88K cache)
- [x] **Mistral 7B v0.3** - Works! (90% GPU, 13.5 GiB, 47K cache)
- [x] **Llama models** - Documented as gated (require HF auth)

### Documentation ✅
- [x] Created docs/MODELS.md with compatibility matrix
- [x] Updated README with model support section
- [x] Documented GPU memory requirements
- [x] Documented authentication for gated models

**Tagged:** v0.0.4 ✅

---

## ✅ 0.0.5 - Production Polish (Complete!)

**Goal:** Make it production-ready ✅

### CLI Improvements ✅
- [x] Clean symbols (→ • ✓ ✗) - no emojis
- [x] Progress indicators (spinner for vLLM startup)
- [x] Colored output (errors in red, success in green)
- [x] --quiet flag (minimal output)
- [x] --json flag (structured output for scripting)
- [x] Redirect vLLM output to vllm.log
- [x] Consistent branding (vllama lowercase)

### Error Handling ✅
- [x] User-friendly error messages
- [x] Helpful suggestions (e.g., "Model not found → Try checking spelling")
- [x] Don't leak stack traces to users
- [x] Proper exit codes (0=success, 1=error, 2=invalid input)
- [x] Context-aware error handling (OOM, port conflicts, missing deps)

### Monitoring ✅
- [x] Enhanced /health endpoint
  - [x] Loaded models
  - [x] GPU status (name, memory, utilization via nvidia-smi)
  - [x] System memory usage
  - [x] vLLM server connectivity status
- [x] Structured JSON logging (VLLAMA_LOG_FORMAT=json)
  - [x] Request IDs (UUID v4)
  - [x] Latency tracking (milliseconds)
  - [x] HTTP status codes
  - [x] Method and URI logging

**Tagged:** v0.0.5 ✅

## 0.0.5.5 - Competitive Analysis Findings

**Key insight:** vllama needs to be "Ollama's DX with vLLM's performance"

**Competitive Moat:**
- **Performance:** 20-30x faster concurrent (vLLM PagedAttention)
- **Production focus:** Built for Linux servers, not hobbyists
- **Advanced features:** Can expose vLLM features Ollama can't (LoRA, speculative decoding)

**NOT competing on:**
- Cross-platform (Ollama wins on Mac/Windows)
- GUI (LMStudio wins)
- Beginner ease (Ollama wins)

**Target users:**
- Production Linux deployments
- High-throughput APIs
- Multi-user concurrent serving
- Teams that need observability

**Critical gaps to close:**
1. Observability (monitoring, metrics, logging)
2. Error handling (user-friendly)
3. Reliability (graceful shutdown, auto-restart)
4. Performance documentation (prove the claims)

## 0.0.6 - Performance Documentation (Week 3)

**Goal:** Document the performance advantage

### Benchmarking
- [ ] Benchmark all tested models
  - Sequential performance
  - Concurrent (5, 10, 50 requests)
  - Memory usage per concurrency level
  - GPU utilization
- [ ] Create docs/PERFORMANCE.md
  - Performance vs Ollama comparison table
  - When to use vllama (production, high throughput)
  - When to use Ollama (hobbyist, macOS)
  - Hardware recommendations

### Update README
- [ ] Performance claims with evidence
- [ ] Link to benchmarks
- [ ] Clear positioning: "Linux + NVIDIA production deployments"

**Tag:** v0.0.6 when done

---

## 0.0.7 - First Production User (Week 4)

**Goal:** Get someone using this in production

### Deployment Guide
- [ ] Docker setup
- [ ] Systemd service file
- [ ] Reverse proxy (nginx/caddy examples)
- [ ] Monitoring setup (Prometheus + Grafana)

### Security
- [ ] Input validation review
- [ ] Rate limiting example
- [ ] Document auth (how to add it)

### Promotion
- [ ] Share on r/LocalLLaMA
- [ ] Share on r/rust
- [ ] Share on Hacker News
- [ ] Position: "vLLM for Ollama users on Linux"

**Success:** 1+ production deployment, real user feedback

**Tag:** v0.0.7 when done

---

## Future (After 0.0.7)

### When to Consider 0.1.0
- ✅ 5+ models tested and working
- ✅ Production deployment guide
- ✅ 1+ real production user
- ✅ Performance fully documented
- ✅ No critical bugs

### What NOT to Do Yet
- ❌ macOS support (see REALISTIC_NEXT_STEPS.md for rationale)
- ❌ Multi-modal (vision)
- ❌ Embeddings (RAG)
- ❌ Quantization
- ❌ Multi-GPU

### Maybe Later (User-Driven)
- [ ] /api/delete endpoint (if users request it)
- [ ] /api/copy endpoint (if users request it)
- [ ] Embeddings (if RAG users appear)
- [ ] Streaming tests (if streaming breaks)

**Strategy:** Stay focused on Linux + NVIDIA production deployments. Let user feedback drive features.
